\section{Hello World!}
\textbf{Hello World!}
Today I am learning {\Large L}A{\Large T}E{\Large X}. LATEX is a great program for writing math. I can write in line math such as $a^2+b^2$. I can also give equations their own space:
\begin{equation}
\gamma^2+\theta^2=\omega^2
\end{equation}
If I do not leave any blank lines LATEX will continue this text without making it into a new paragraph. Notice how there was no indentation in the text after equation (1). Also notice how even though I hit enter after that sentence and here $\downarrow$ LATEX formats the sentence without any break. Also look how it doesn't
matter how many spaces I put between any words. \\ 
Hello GitHub! My latex page is this!! Welcome.

For a new paragraph I can leave a blank space in my code.
